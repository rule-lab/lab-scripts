Monte requires an older version of the fortran compiler than can be found in the
"current" repositories for Ubuntu. Here is Kaustubh's instructive guide to
manually adding the older package for installation.

####

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

add this line:

deb http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu/ hardy-updates main universe
[a complete list of mirror sites are given here:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy-updates/i386/g77-3.4/download]

save and close the file

logout, login

open synaptics: if you don't see the "http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu/
hardy-updates main universe" in the source-list on the left, press
"Reload"

choose
http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu/ hardy-updates main universe from the left
column - this should show the list of packages. choose g77 from the list,
mark for installation and apply.

monte should work now.

go back to the source file and comment out the line you added.

** Also needed are versions 8.0.4 or later of tcl and tk - this is
straightforward - just use the latest version in synaptics.
